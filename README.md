# Prostitute Mod for Gta IV

Since no one made it properly, I decided to make it myself

A lot of ideas from this [mod](https://libertycity.net/files/gta-4/71666-prostitution-mod-v0.9.html)

## How to use

Put "ProstituteModGtaIV\TestScriptCS\Scripts\ProstituteMod.cs" to your script in the GTA IV game folder, require .NET script hook GTA IV.

The script is activated by pressing the **F7 (or T) key** for the keyboard or the **"Down Arrow"** key for the controller, after which the model of the main character (Niko) is replaced with a cute girl (if you installed my componentpeds.img) or a randomly generated priestess of love.

Press the **F7 (or T)** key for the keyboard or the **"Down Arrow"** key again to turn back to Niko.

Next, choose a sidewalk that is more convenient and use the **F1 (or Shift + T)** key for the keyboard or the **"A (X)" and "Down Arrow"** keys for the controller to start luring customers "on wheels." If you're lucky (the chance to be lucky is actually really high), the car will slow down and beep twice. At this time, the "Press and hold Action button" will appear in the upper left corner of the screen! Press and hold the "Action" key (default is the **"F"** key for the keyboard or **Y (Triangle)** for the controller). After that, the character will be in the car in the front passenger seat and the car will move on.

While in the car, press the **F1 (or Shift + T)** key for the keyboard or the **"A (X)" and "Down Arrow"** keys for the controller to initialize the sex, or just leave the car if you don't feel to it is a good time to have fun.

Even though it's unintentional, if you get in the car when there are police nearby, you will get 1 star wanted. So be careful not to get arrested for prostitution.

For female drivers, the main character can only serve blowjob. For male one, she can serve both bj and sex. I also added some voice playing when luring and sex (no bj sounds in the original game though).

The client pays with you in cash from 20 to 50 (bj) or 40 to 70 dollars (sex), then stops and you automatically leave the transport.

## Some notes

The script was developed and tested on a patch 1.0.7.0 with installed .Net Script Hook v1.7.1.7b, if you plan to use on Complete Version one you need either downgrade or the [Compatibility patch for ScriptHook](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta4mods/g17media/26726-compatibility-patch-for-gta-iv-complete-edition/).

You will have sex on the car running, or I can make it stop but no way I can make it like the driver drives you to the secluded area and have sex, it is beyond my ability right now (and maybe in the future too, unless someone can help me about it).

If you are using ped skins and go to cutscene, you will get crash. It is caused by Rock \* and I can't fix about it. You need to change it back Niko skin or using special skins which completely replace Niko. If you plan to using the special skins, you can use the "ProstituteMod_EX.cs" file instead (no need to press F7 to start).
